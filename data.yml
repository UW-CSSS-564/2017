      notes: >
        The *Statistical Rethinking* chapter provides some of the
        theoretical background on MCMC sampling. The various readings
        about Stan and **rstan** all provide some overview and instructions for
        Stan models, though all assume at various parts knowledge that I don't expect
        all (if any) students to have. They are often written for someone who is
        already familiar with Bayesian statistics and software. The best
        strategy is to scan them, and if there are parts that assume knowledge you
        aren't familiar with, don't worry about it. Reading the introduction to the *Stan Documentation*
        is as much about getting familiar with what's in this documentation as anything else.
        The Stan Modeling Language Documentation includes both extensive documentation
        about the language and functions and many example models.
