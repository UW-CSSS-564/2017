Instructions for Jeff's office hours:

1. Sign up for a 30-minute slot using the Google Calendar appointments link emailed to the class.

2. Email me 24 hours prior to your appointment with what you would like to discuss.

These instructions will ensure that our time is efficiently spent and I can be of the most help to you.

#### Communication

In this course we will be using [Slack](https://slack.com/) for online class discussion. You will not be required to post, but the system is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently from classmates, and the instructors.
Rather than emailing questions to the instructors, post your questions to [https://uwcsss564.slack.com/](Slack).
You should have received an invitation to join this team, if not contact us to receive an invite.

# Texts

- McElreath. 2015. [Statistical Rethking](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/p/book/9781482253443). The [CRC page](https://www.crcpress.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-Stan/McElreath/p/book/9781482253443) has an eBook, though [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/1482253445) does not.
- (Optional) Gelman, Andrew, John B. Carlin, Hal S. Stern, David B. Dunson, Aki Vehtrai, and Donald B. Rubin. 2013. [Bayesian Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439840954/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). 3rd ed. The 3rd edition is significantly changed from the 2nd edition. This provides a good reference for concepts and models beyond what is covered in *Statistical Rethinking*

Additional readings are on the [schedule](schedule.html).

# Software

For computation, this course will rely upon

- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/): a language for statistical computing
- [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/): a probabilistic programming language for writing and estimating Bayesian models

Both **R** and **Stan** are free and open-source. 

I expect that students will already be familiar with **R**, so class time will not be spent introducing it in order to familiarize students with **Stan**.

Though not necessary, you are encouraged to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) Desktop integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
